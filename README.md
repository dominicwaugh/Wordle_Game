# Wordle_Game
This is a working functioning wordle game that takes any dictionary in any language that is added as a file and uses every string in that file that is 5 characters long.
Each line in the dictionaries are considered a word so in order for the program to run effectively, the file must have a line space between each desired word.  
  
### This is a command line program  
- In order to run this program, first enter the src folder using command line: "cd src"  
- Next, compile the program with the line: "javac SequenceGuesser.java"
- Then, to run the program, enter "java SequenceGuesser fileName" with the fileName being the file that comes with the program or the name of a personal file that has been imported.
For example, "java SequenceGuesser vocab.nytimes.random.txt." This uses the NY Times words list and this will function close to the NY Times Wordle.
- Follow the directions. The yellow letters are letters that are present and out of place, the greens ones are correct and in place, and the grey are not present in the target word.
- Your name will be inputted into a leaderboard and displayed if you get a high enough score.
- Enter your feedback and I will update the game based off of the feedback given.
